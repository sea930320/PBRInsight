          <p>
            Access to the Services is restricted to the specific named users as identified to PBR. The subscriber will
            notify PBR as soon as a user has left the company, or no longer requires access, so that a replacement user
            can be assigned access during the term of the agreement. The Subscriber also warrants that: it shall ensure
            that any user name, Password or other identification measure employed to access the Services is not
            disclosed to any person other than the persons authorised to access the same; and all authorised persons
            will use the Services only in accordance with this Agreement; and its information technology systems and

          </p>
          <h6>3. OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h6>
          <p>
            The Subscriber acknowledges that:<br />
            • all Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (including all patents, copyrights, rights in software, design
            rights, trade marks, service marks, trade secrets, know-how, database rights, domain names, and all other
            intellectual or industrial property rights (whether registered or unregistered)) and all applications for
            the same, anywhere in the world) in the Services, the information contained therein, in all documentation,
            training materials and related matter, and in all parts thereof, are owned by PBR; <br />
            • that it does not have any IPR nor any other proprietary interests in the Services, or in any data or
            material contained in it; and <br />
            • except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, nothing herein shall be taken as conferring by
            implication, estoppel or otherwise any license or right to use any IPR in the Services without the prior
            written approval of PBR or third parties who may own such IPR.
            The Subscriber undertakes that it will not copy, reproduce, extract or transmit in any form or otherwise
            deal with in any way, the whole or part of the data, materials or information contained in the Services
            except as provided in sub-clauses below.
            Unless otherwise agreed in writing in advance by PBR, the material (in whole or in part) may not be sold,
            nor passed on, communicated, or disseminated in any form, nor access granted to any third party (including
            but not limited to clients/potential clients/suppliers/agents/partners in other
            ventures/accountants/solicitors/bankers/ brokers/licensees), nor to any subsidiary, associated or holding
            company (whether direct or indirect) of the subscriber, whether trading or non-trading, or to any entity
            trading under the same umbrella trading name where the direct equity interest is different in any way to
            that of the subscriber.
            The Subscriber may only use the Services in the course of its own normal day-to-day business. Subscriber
            may not pass materials to clients and prospects unless done so as part of a presentation or similar, where
            PBR is referenced as owner of all copyrights and intellectual property, and that passing material to third
            parties is carried out on an ad-hoc non-systematic basis.
            Where the Subscriber effectively copies, or has effectively copied, the intellectual property onto a hard
            disk, file server or equivalent at its own premises for ease of use, reference or any other reason, it is
            hereby agreeing to limit access to the nominated users unless otherwise agreed in writing, and upon payment
            of additional fees to PBR.
            Subscriber may distribute copies in paper and/or electronic form of material so long as all copies made are
            distributed within the immediate organisation of the Subscriber and the Subscriber acknowledges that any
            distribution to any third party outside of its organisation (including without limitation any subsidiary,
            associated or holding company of the Subscriber) then it will indemnify PBR against any claim arising from
            the unauthorised distribution and be liable for a sum equivalent to the loss in sales revenue (at the
            prevailing copy price per whole report or the rate card price for an annual subscription to the relevant
            database as published from time to time by PBR) caused by any unauthorised distribution of any part(s) of
            any report(s).
            The Subscriber, (or any subsequent user, whether licensed or unlicensed), will not place financial reliance
            upon any figure, statement or inference contained within any PBR's report or intellectual property, or
            invite investment from others, without first obtaining the written consent of PBR's so to do. In the event
            that the Subscriber (or any subsequent user, whether licensed or unlicensed) does not follow this
            procedure, it (or any subsequent user, whether licensed or unlicensed) agrees to fully and effectually
            indemnify PBR against any claims, howsoever arising.
          </p>
          <h6>4. SUBSCRIPTION PRICE</h6>
          <p>
            The subscription price excludes VAT (unless otherwise stated) and sales taxes, local and business taxes and
            all other charges that are the responsibility of the Subscriber. No deduction should be made in relation to
            payment of the subscription price except for withholding tax governed by a double tax treaty between the
            country of the Subscriber and the Nigerian state.
          </p>
          <h6>5. PAYMENT</h6>
          <p>

            the Agreement in accordance with clause 7, and the Subscriber undertakes to settle invoices issued by PBR
            in respect of the Services within 30 days of receipt, unless otherwise specifically agreed. If any payment
            is not made as due, then all outstanding amounts for the subscription shall immediately become due and
            payable. Failure to settle in full on these terms may lead to the imposition of interest charges upon the
            Subscriber at 6.5% per annum. PBR will not provide a pro rata refund once such a subscription has been made
            available to the subscriber, as all subscriptions will run their full term.
          </p>
          <h6>6. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY</h6>
          <p>
            i) Except as provided in clause 6 (ii), all conditions and warranties whether express or implied by statute
            or otherwise (including but not limited to those as to description, merchantability or fitness for purpose)
            are excluded from this agreement.<br />
            ii) In particular whilst PBR aims to ensure that material contained within the Services is accurate and
            complete, PBR gives no warranty, express or implied, that the material supplied as part of the Services is
            suitable for any particular purpose, nor that it is complete, correct, or up to date.<br />
            iii) PBR will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the Services and any software relating thereto
            provided by PBR will perform in accordance with any PBR user guide that is available. In the event of an
            established failure of the Services, PBR's obligation shall be limited to using its reasonable efforts to
            remedy any deficiencies in the relevant Services, or at its option, to cancelling, crediting or refunding
            all charges due from the Subscriber in respect of any period for which the Services have failed to perform
            correctly. The obligation to correct defects or cancel, credit or refund a proportionate part of the
            charges described above shall constitute the full extent of PBR's liability in respect of any loss or
            damage sustained by the Subscriber whether caused by breach of this Agreement, misrepresentation,
            negligence of PBR (or its employees or agents) or from any other cause, and in particular, PBR shall not be
            liable for any consequential, economic or other direct or indirect loss (including but not limited to any
            damages payable to a third party, loss of profits or wasted resources) suffered by the Subscriber, provided
            that if for any reason this provision is invalid or unenforceable, the maximum aggregate liability of PBR
            shall not exceed the total annual charges payable by the Subscriber for the Services. The foregoing
            exclusions and limitations of liability shall not apply in the case of death or personal injury.
          </p>

            shall have been given to the defaulting party. Termination of this Agreement for any reason shall not
            affect PBR's right to recover any moneys due at the time of termination or to recover damages for any
            breach of contract before termination.
